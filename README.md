# Sudoku Solver

Sudoku Solver is a Java project that implements a Sudoku game with a (9 x 9) grid. It provides functionality to solve Sudoku puzzles and allows users to play the game interactively. This README file provides an overview of the project, its functionalities, tech stack, and the author's information.

## Functionalities

The Sudoku Solver project offers the following functionalities:

1. **Reset Game**: This functionality allows the user to reset the Sudoku game, clearing the entire grid and starting a new game. It provides a fresh start for the user to solve a new puzzle or retry the current puzzle.

2. **Exit the Game**: This functionality enables the user to exit the Sudoku game. When selected, it terminates the program and closes the game window.

3. **Show Solution and Hide Solution**: This functionality provides the option to show or hide the solution for the Sudoku puzzle. When the user chooses to show the solution, the program will display the correct solution on the grid. This feature can be helpful when the user gets stuck or wants to verify their own solution. The user can also choose to hide the solution to continue solving the puzzle independently.

4. **Check Moves**: The check moves functionality allows the user to validate their current progress in the Sudoku game. By selecting this option, the program will evaluate the user's inputs and provide feedback on the correctness of the moves. It will highlight any incorrect numbers or cells, indicating which areas need correction. This functionality helps users identify mistakes and make necessary adjustments to reach the correct solution.

## Tech Stack

- Java: The project is implemented in Core Java, which serves as the primary programming language.
